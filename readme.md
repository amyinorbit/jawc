# Just Another Wordle Clone

I needed a quick, basic side project, and I wanted to be able to play wordle in my terminal.
That's pretty much it! Answers are (very, very poorly) encrypted using XOR. The code is my work,
but the concept is obviously not mine -- [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is a
pretty addictive word game designed by Josh Wardle.
